## Basic
Functional programming involves working less with variables

#### Value
immutable: cannot be reassigned
```
val x: Int = 2
```

#### Variables
mutable: can be reassigned
```
var x: Int = 1
x = 1
x += 1
```

- Functional Programming prefer vals over vars
- All vals and vars have types
- compiler automatically infers types when omitted
- basic types
    - Boolean
    - Int, Long, Short, Float, Double
    - String, Character
